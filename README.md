# Social-Network-API

## Description
This project was created as the backend of a social network website to test RESTful API routes with the use of a noSQL database. The code uses Mongoose as an ODM( Object document Mapping) tool to interact with the document as a JavaScript Object. The website is made modeling code used in activities from a coding boot camp. 

## Usage
To use the application, the user must first open the terminal, navigate through directories and locate Social-Network-API. Once there, the user must run "npm run start" to run the server.js file that will run the application along with the API routes and queries. In order to test the API routes, the user must use a tester such as Insomnia or ThunderClient. [User Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bgCjHBNg4pMrx0M1mN9H0dpXDiwYGAhf/view)

The code was also built by understanding concepts in class and recreating examples from excercises worked through the course.
